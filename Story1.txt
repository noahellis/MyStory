My name is Noah, and this is my story.

I've started programming school to find a better career and provide a living for my family, including my unborn child.

I hope my income is high enough to support and provides me with the happiness I seek for my family.   

This is my story thus far.

This is Justin adding to Noahâ€™s story.  I am in this program for many of the same

reasons that Noah is.  I am trying to get a better job so I can marry my girlfriend and provide for my young puppy.
