My name is Noah, and this is my story. 

I've started programming school to find a better carreer and provide a living for my family, including my unborn child. 

I hope my income is high enough to support the family without the wife having to work, even though she will want to at some point I'm sure. 

This is my story thus far. 

This is Justin adding to Noah's story.  I am in this program for many of the same

reasons that Noah is.  I am trying to get a better job so I can marry my girlfriend

soon and give us a better life.


THIS IS CHARLES HEAR ME ROAR (meow)
